jquery-imageloader
==================

jQuery.imageloader() lets you load images lazily.  It is designed to be memory less intensive, cleaning up all after done and using a singleton-style queue mechanism so that it won't overwhelm browser UI thread.

todo: maybe count seconds and if still not loading all, should fire error?
